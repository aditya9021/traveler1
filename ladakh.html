          Talking about the first things first, every biker must give his or her total attention to their first love, which is their bike. One must be very careful and picky when it comes to choosing their Leh Ladakh road trip bike. So whenever you’re choosing a bike for any road trip, make sure you go for suitability more than popularity. Consider it one of the most vital aspects of your Leh Ladakh bike trip plan!<br>

          Opting for the kind of bikes that one can easily handle and are easy to maintain, has always proven to be safe, and helpful for the riders for journeys like Leh Ladakh bike trip. Hence, the five best bikes for Leh Ladakh bike trip are:<br><br>

          Royal Enfield –<br> Considered to be the best bike for Leh Ladakh trip, it is a powerful bike with an engine of either 350 CC or 500 CC that is enough to be a lifesaver on a Leh Ladakh bullet trip.<br><br>
          Royal Enfield Himalayan –<br> With a strong engine of 400 CC, Royal Enfield Himalayan will make your ride smooth and hassle-free on any rugged trail and offbeat roads.<br><br>
          Bajaj Pulsar –<br> By far, no bike has been a hit in the Indian market when compared to Bajaj Pulsar. Being the most favored bike after the Bullets, Pulsar offers variants of 150CC, 200CC, and 220CC, either of which can be your trustworthy partner on any of the adventures.<br><br>
          KTM Duke – <br>Being a featherweight bike can be advantageous on roads like that of Ladakh. With the series of new engine variants of Duke 390, and Duke 250, KTM can be a good choice for a bike trip to Ladakh too.<br><br>
          CBR 250 –<br> This bike from Honda is indeed a stunner except for its Contigo tyres which can be a little tough to handle on Ladakh’s terrain in case of a change in weather. On the bright side, if the tyres can be replaced, one can put the bike’s torque and fi technology to great use, and a greater purpose.<br><br>
          Other top bikes for Leh Ladakh trip that the association of bike rentals has taken into consideration are Yamaha Fazer, Bajaj Vikrant, Yamaha FZ, and Hero Impulse.

<img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2017/05/46.jpg"></img>
Keeping petrol as the priority for a bike trip, at an average, you’ll be covering a distance of 3500 kilometers. Of all the bikes that have been considered, the average mileage is that of 35 kilometers per liter. This means that you’ll be needing somewhere around 100 litres of petrol for which, you will roughly need an amount of INR 7000 to INR 8,000.<br>

<p class="blog-head">Accommodation</p><br>
<img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2017/05/415.jpg"></img>
There are a lot of budget hotels in Leh Ladakh wherein one can find easy accommodation options within the range of INR 500 to INR 2,500 per person, on a double-sharing basis, and including taxes (as per booking.com).<br>

Hence, the rate for an average accommodation with the best of amenities, comfort, and ratings, can cost you INR 500 to INR 2,500 per night per person depending on whether you want a budget hotel or luxury. Considering the lower limit, a 15-day trip will cost you a rough figure of INR 7,500 for accommodation. Let’s round it off to INR 8,000 per person.<br>

<p class="blog-head">Meals</p><br>
<img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2017/05/519.jpg"></img>
Similarly, the cost of food depends on the choice of the rider whether he or she prefers to eat at a dhaba or a restaurant. Eating at a dhaba may cost you INR 100 to INR 150 whereas dining at a normal and a bit upbeat restaurant may cost you about INR 400 to INR 500 per person on your tour to Leh Ladakh. Considering the lower limit, you’ll be spending close to INR 2,250 to INR 6,000 on meals. At an average, you can keep INR 3,500 aside for meals<br>

<p class="blog-head">Miscellaneous</p><br>
<img src="https://img.traveltriangle.com/blog/wp-content/tr:w-700,h-400/uploads/2017/05/7.jpeg"></img>
It is a must to keep some amount of money aside for emergency purposes, shopping for souvenirs, or for permits. Thus, an amount of INR 2,500 to INR 5,000 is a must for every biker to spread it across the luggage or pockets and save it as a backup.<br>
Average Budget = Petrol + Accommodation + Meals + Miscellaneous = 7000 + 8000 + 3500 + 2500 = INR 21,000/-<br>

Thus, considering all the lower limits, an average budget for a 15-day Leh Ladakh bike trip would be INR 21,000 per person.<br>

Please Note: We’re assuming you have a bike of your own as the budget doesn’t include the cost of bike rental. Hence, in case you plan on renting a bike, the budget would exceed by a minimum of INR 13,500 to INR 15,000 per bike for a minimum of 15 days.<br>
